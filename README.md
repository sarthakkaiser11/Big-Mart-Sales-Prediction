# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
This project involves building a regression model to predict the sales of products at Big Mart stores. Using the Big Mart Sales dataset, the model accurately forecasts sales based on various features such as item type, item MRP, and outlet location. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building with linear regression, and evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
